# U-Net-Segmentation
3D U-Net Implementation Based on TensorFlow

To Do List:
1. conv_def: Dilated Convolution 
2. loss_def: Problem with dice loss, softmax to be checked, remove dice~
3. *data_io: discard the resize, other data argumentation, normalization over the whole dataset
4. new: visualization of data
5. new: improve the sampling method -> cube or go all
5. *test function!
6. paper!
7. model: feature number variant
